                Megan joined the Wil la mootk team in 2022. Originally from Hawaii, Megan graduated from the University of Washington in 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in literature. She moved to Alaska in 2006 and pursued a variety of jobs, including
                commercial fishing. In 2008, she joined a peer support group, and experienced firsthand the power of psychotherapy to heal and transform lives. She was inspired to pursue a career in mental health counseling, and completed a Master of
                Science in Counseling Psychology at Capella University in 2012. Before moving to Metlakatla, Megan worked as a Licensed Professional Counselor at several agencies in Ketchikan, gaining knowledge and experience especially in working
                with children in the foster care system and with survivors of domestic violence and other traumas.
                <br /><br />
                Megan is passionate about helping people to see their own innocence and to feel hopeful about their futures. Megan’s greatest joy in life is being a mother to her 10-year-old son. She is grateful to be able to raise him in Metlakatla
                where he can experience a close-knit community and learn about indigenous culture and values.

                Allison joined the Wil la mootk Counseling Center as a clinician in January of this year 2023 and is our newest addition to the team. Passionate about the immaculate nature and mysteries of Psyche, she enjoys curating creative and
                explorative space for individuals and groups. Her avid curiosities have led her to the jungles of Costa Rica and Columbia where she studied alternative healing and the repressed feminine mythologies. These discoveries catapulted her
                back to her homeland of California where she worked as a dancer, filmmaker, and ceremonialist. Trauma, a taboo subject, is one of her muses as she sees contending with it as an initiatory gateway into a greater Eros-infused life.
                <br /><br />
                Some of her previous work has focused on bringing the arts to foster youth and individuals wrestling with homelessness, addiction, victims and survivors of sexual exploitation, and souls on the precipice of major breakthroughs.
                <br /><br />
                Along with her Masters of Arts in Clinical and Depth Psychology, she is also trained and certified in Danyasa Yoga Arts, Shadow Work facilitation, Shamanic Fusion Dance, is a graduate of multiple mystery schools, and is an ordained
                priestess in the medicine of movement. She is currently working towards her Ph.D. in Archetypal Studies.
                <br /><br />
                In her free time Allison enjoys international flights, writing, dancing her prayers into the ocean, making experimental films, hiking, and dinners out with friends and family. While she loves California, her heart is enjoying opening
                to the idiosyncrasies and beauties of Alaska. The Pacific Ocean is one she is loyal to.

                been his thing and he graduated with 8 other students in his high school senior class. He took a roundabout way getting into the behavioral health world. His experience includes 10 years in the US Air Force, working in avionics and
                air traffic control.
                <br /><br />

                direct care and in various supervisory capacities. His experience includes emergency room crisis management, inpatient psychiatric hospital, community mental health, and wilderness therapy. He has a passion for the outdoors and loves
                using nature as a therapeutic tool. He comments that “healing happens as we mindfully engage in healthy relationships” and that “Nature is the greatest healer of all.”

                Edith Guthrie has been a hobby sized business owner selling pizza and breakfast bagel sandwiches. During the early part of that business, she noticed Wil la mootk Counseling Center – its great public work in the community and how its
                presence made “A Place of healing” inviting and comforting. At first, she was asked to cater for the grand opening of the new building, and this began her wish to be more involved.
                <br /><br />
                Edi began her work at Wil la mootk in May 2017 as Administrative Assistant. Happy to become a part of healing in her own hometown of Metlakatla, Alaska, she enjoyed helping every part of Team Wil la mootk “Make It Happen”. In 2019 she
                became Business Manager and delved deeper into learning policies and procedures for Wil la mootk Counseling Center, CARF, MIC, State of Alaska and Federal regulations.
                <br /><br />
                Edi has a background that includes a certificate in Medical Billing and Office Automation but also a vast collection of job types, her favorites being an Optician and work as a cook & deckhand on the AMHS ferry system. Being a wife
                and mother is the first part of her life’s work, yet is currently she is working at finishing her bachelor’s degree in business management with a Human Resource Certificate and is also studying to become certified in billing and
                compliance. Edi’s greatest endeavor is to create awareness and increase opportunities for people to heal in every part of their lives and experience.
